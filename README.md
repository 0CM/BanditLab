Ubuntu based Linux VM for Digital Forensics
----------------
Lightweight linux distribution for digital forensic and incident response. 
Primarily to be used on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 based systems.

\* x86\_64 binaries will be ported later.

Prerequisites:
---------------
**Multipass**

Ubuntu Multipass is a tool developed by Canonical that allows users to create, manage, 
and configure lightweight virtual machines (VMs) on their local system, 
specifically designed for Ubuntu environments.

Installation:

* via Brew -> brew install multipass 
* via stand alone installer -> <https://multipass.run/install>

Lab Deployment:
----------------
The following command will create VM called BanditLab with 2GB RAM and 15GB disk.
 - VM name and HW specs can be changes accordingly to you preferences 

 * multipass launch -n BanditLab -m 2GB -d 15G --cloud-init https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0CM/BinaryBanditsForensicLab/main/BanditLab.yaml

Log into the VM:
 * multipass shell BanditLab

Stop the VM:
 * multipass stop BanditLab

Delete the VM:
 * multipass delete BanditLab
 * multipass purge

Share folder between the VM and host system:
 * multipass mount path/to/local/folder BanditLab:/home/ubuntu/DATA
